## Community Guidelines

### Career-Specific Considerations

Given that My CV Tailor deals with sensitive professional information:

* **Respect confidentiality** - Never share or discuss specific user career details publicly
* **Maintain accuracy standards** - Support the project's safety-first approach to CV generation
* **Be constructive with career feedback** - Focus on helpful, actionable advice
* **Avoid career gatekeeping** - Welcome people at all career stages and backgrounds
* **Support professional growth** - Help others improve their job search success

### Technical Collaboration

* **Be patient with different skill levels** - Not everyone has the same technical background
* **Provide clear, helpful feedback** on contributions
* **Test thoroughly** before submitting changes that affect user career documents
* **Document clearly** to help others understand and contribute
* **Respect different AI platforms and tools** - The community uses various AI assistants

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by:

* **Creating a private issue** on GitHub
* **Emailing the maintainers** directly (contact information will be provided in repository settings)
* **Using GitHub's built-in reporting features** for serious violations

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Response Process

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

1. **Acknowledgment** - We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** - We will investigate the incident and gather relevant information
3. **Decision** - We will determine appropriate consequences based on our guidelines
4. **Communication** - We will communicate the outcome to relevant parties

## Special Considerations for Career-Related Content

### Privacy and Sensitivity
Given the personal nature of career information:
* **Anonymize examples** when discussing CV improvements or issues
* **Respect job search confidentiality** - job searching can be sensitive
* **Be mindful of career anxiety** - job searching is stressful for many people
* **Support career transitions** - people changing fields need extra encouragement

### Professional Standards
* **Maintain accuracy** - never encourage false information in CVs
* **Support honesty** - help people represent themselves truthfully
* **Respect all career paths** - every job and experience has value
* **Encourage growth** - focus on helping people improve and develop
