## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Quality Guidelines

### Safety-First Principles
- **Never assume or generate content** not explicitly provided by users
- **Always verify information** through targeted questions
- **Maintain transparency** about what data is verified vs. unverified
- **Protect user privacy** - all processing happens locally
- **Preserve accuracy** - every claim must be interview-defensible

### Code Quality Standards
- **Clear Documentation**: Every .mdc rule should have clear instructions
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle missing files or malformed data
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear status updates and guidance
- **Testing**: Verify functionality across different platforms
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Don't break existing user data

## üèóÔ∏è Development Workflow

### For .mdc Rule Development
1. **Study existing rules** in the `/rules` directory
2. **Follow the conversational pattern** established in `setup.mdc`
3. **Test thoroughly** with different input scenarios
4. **Document any new placeholders** or data requirements
5. **Update template instructions** if needed

### For Template Development
1. **Start with existing template** as a base
2. **Test with sample data** before submitting
3. **Verify PDF export quality** across browsers
4. **Check ATS compatibility** using online ATS testing tools
5. **Document any special requirements** or features

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create a feature branch** from main
2. **Make your changes** following our standards
3. **Test thoroughly** across different scenarios
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Submit pull request** using our template
6. **Respond to feedback** and iterate as needed
