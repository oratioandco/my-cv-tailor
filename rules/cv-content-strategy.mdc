# CV Content Strategy Guidelines

## Goal
Ensure the first CV generation meets professional standards without requiring multiple iterations for layout, content selection, or strategic positioning.

## Key Lessons from AirHelp CV Development

### Typography & Layout Standards
- **Use HTML/CSS template**: `/templates/cv-template-modern.html` (NOT SVG)
- **Proper typographic hierarchy**: 32px above section titles, 8px below
- **Consistent spacing**: All section titles have identical relationship to their content
- **Professional layout**: Two-column page 1, single-column page 2
- **Clean visual hierarchy**: Headers clearly associated with content below

### Content Selection Strategy

#### ONGOING Section Rules
**INCLUDE:**
- Job title, company name, dates, location
- Current roles that show professional activity

**EXCLUDE:**
- Detailed descriptions unless directly relevant to target role
- Consulting project specifics that distract from core positioning
- Mentoring details that don't support strategic narrative
- Any content that creates visual clutter without strategic value

**Principle**: ONGOING section should demonstrate active engagement without distracting from main qualifications

#### Experience Organization
**Recent Detailed (Last 5-7 years):**
- Full IMPACT framework application
- Strategic business context
- Quantified outcomes where available
- Cross-functional collaboration emphasis

**Earlier Career Progression:**
- Consolidated under single section
- Brief descriptions focusing on progression narrative
- Remove detailed bullets for older roles
- Show career trajectory without overwhelming detail

#### Strategic Content Principles
1. **Relevance Over Completeness**: Include only information that supports target role positioning
2. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer, stronger examples than many weak ones
3. **Strategic Positioning**: Every piece of content should advance the candidacy narrative
4. **Interview Readiness**: All claims must be defensible with specific examples

### Profile Section Guidelines
- **Avoid unsupported claims**: Don't mention industries you haven't worked in
- **Focus on transferable value**: Emphasize B2B/B2C experience over specific sectors
- **Quantified achievements**: Only include metrics you can verify and defend
- **Strategic language**: Position for target role without overstating background

### Location Accuracy Standards
- **Always verify company locations** against user's actual experience
- **Common mistakes to avoid**: 
  - HairDirect: Lancaster, PA (NOT Roseville, CA)
  - Datameer team: Germany and NYC only (NOT San Francisco)
- **Double-check all geographical references** before finalizing

### Company Context Strategy
- **Accurate business descriptions**: Use verified industry language
- **Strategic relevance**: Emphasize aspects that connect to target role
- **Consistent formatting**: Company name + strategic context + location

### Skills Section Organization
- **Strategic grouping**: Mobile Design Leadership, Strategic Design, Technical Expertise, Industry Knowledge
- **Relevant emphasis**: Highlight skills that directly support target role
- **Avoid skill inflation**: Only include verified capabilities
- **Professional presentation**: Clean categories with strategic relevance
