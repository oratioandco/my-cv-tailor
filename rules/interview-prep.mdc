# Rule: Interview Preparation (Strategic Question Anticipation)

## Goal
Prepare users for interviews by analyzing job requirements, user background, and potential concern areas to identify likely questions and develop strategic responses. Focus on building confidence through thorough preparation of both strength-based and challenging topics.

## System Context Integration
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Load comprehensive user context to personalize preparation:

1. **Read Job Analysis**: `/data/job-analysis/[job-title]-analysis.md` for role-specific requirements and company context
2. **Read User Profile**: `/data/user-profile.md` for career stage, communication style, and identified strengths/gaps
3. **Read All Experience Files**: `/data/experiences/` for verified achievements and strategic positioning
4. **Read Verification Logs**: `/data/verification-log/` for interview-ready STAR stories and confidence levels
5. **Read Core System Prompt**: `/system-prompt/core-system-prompt.md` for IMPACT framework and positioning strategy

## Prerequisites
- Job analysis completed (`analyze-job-posting.mdc`)
- Experience verification completed (`verify-experience.mdc`)
- CV generated with strategic positioning

## WORKFLOW POSITION
This rule is Step 4 in the application sequence:
1. ‚úÖ Job analysis (`analyze-job-posting.mdc`)
2. ‚úÖ Experience verification (`verify-experience.mdc`)
3. ‚úÖ CV generation (`generate-cv.mdc`)
4. ‚è≥ **CURRENT:** Interview preparation (`interview-prep.mdc`)
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è **OPTIONAL:** Mock interview (`mock-interview.mdc`)

## Interview Preparation Process

### Step 1: Comprehensive Question Analysis

#### Question Categories to Analyze

**1. Role-Specific Technical Questions**
Based on job requirements analysis from `/data/job-analysis/[job-title]-analysis.md`:
- Must-have skills and competencies from job posting
- Nice-to-have qualifications that may come up
- Industry-specific knowledge areas highlighted in posting
- Technical tools and methodologies mentioned
- Process and framework experience required
- Leadership and management capabilities (if applicable)
- Company-specific context and challenges identified

**2. Experience-Based Behavioral Questions**
Based on user's documented experience in `/data/experiences/`:
- Achievement-focused questions mapped to verified STAR stories
- Challenge and problem-solving scenarios from experience files
- Leadership and influence examples from verified experiences
- Collaboration and team work stories with documented outcomes
- Innovation and improvement initiatives with impact evidence
- Cross-reference with job requirements to predict likely behavioral questions

**3. Potential Concern Areas**
Based on profile analysis and experience gaps from job analysis:
- Career transitions and switches (identify from experience timeline)
- Short employment stints (flag positions < 18 months)
- Experience level mismatches (compare years required vs actual)
- Company size/stage differences (startup to enterprise, etc.)
- Geographic or industry changes (different markets/domains)
- Skills or experience gaps identified in verification process
- Education/certification gaps compared to job requirements

**4. Strategic Positioning Questions**
Based on target role alignment from job analysis:
- Why are you interested in this role/company? (company context from analysis)
- How does this fit your career trajectory? (progression narrative)
- What value would you bring to this position? (strength areas from verification)
- How do you see yourself growing in this role? (development areas identified)
- What differentiates you from other candidates? (unique value proposition)
- Questions about company culture fit based on job posting tone/values

### Step 2: Question Likelihood Assessment

#### High Probability Questions (90%+ likely)
Questions virtually guaranteed to be asked:
- "Tell me about yourself" (always asked)
- "Why are you interested in this role?" (based on job analysis)
- "What are your strengths?" (map to job requirements)
- Role-specific competency questions (from must-have requirements)
- Questions about recent experience and achievements (from CV)

#### Medium Probability Questions (60-80% likely)
Questions commonly asked based on role level and type:
- Behavioral questions about specific situations (STAR stories from experiences)
- Questions about career goals and trajectory (based on user profile career stage)
- Team collaboration and leadership examples (if leadership mentioned in job)
- Problem-solving and challenge scenarios (common for senior roles)
- Questions about company culture fit (based on job posting tone)

#### Concern-Based Questions (30-60% likely)
Questions that may arise based on profile analysis and experience gaps:

**Career Pattern Concerns:**
- Career change explanations (if industry/role switch detected)
- Short stint explanations (positions < 18 months from experience files)
- Employment gap explanations (gaps > 6 months in timeline)
- Frequent job changes (> 3 roles in 5 years pattern)

**Experience Level Concerns:**
- Experience level justifications (years required vs actual from profile)
- Skill gap acknowledgments (missing requirements from job analysis)
- Seniority level fit (junior applying for senior, senior to mid-level)
- Education/certification gaps (if mentioned in job requirements)

**Company/Industry Fit Concerns:**
- Company stage/size fit discussions (startup experience to enterprise role)
- Industry transition explanations (different domain experience)
- Geographic relocation reasoning (if location change detected)
- Remote work experience (if job is remote/hybrid)

**Role-Specific Concerns:**
- Management readiness (if leadership role but limited management experience)
- Technical depth (if technical role but limited recent technical work)
- Strategic thinking (if senior role but primarily operational experience)
- Cultural fit (if company values significantly different from past employers)

### Step 3: Strategic Response Development

#### Response Framework
For each identified question topic:

**Strength-Based Responses:**
- Primary STAR story with full context
- Supporting examples and evidence
- Strategic positioning elements
- Confidence level and preparation depth

**Concern-Based Responses:**
- Honest acknowledgment approach
- Bridge to relevant experience
- Learning and growth narrative
- Enthusiasm and commitment demonstration
