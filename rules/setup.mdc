# Rule: My CV Tailor Setup (Conversational Onboarding)

## Goal
Guide new users through a friendly, conversational setup process that ensures their CV data is properly imported and their professional profile is well-understood for optimal customization.

## Conversational Flow

### Opening: Welcome & Overview
```
üëã Welcome to My CV Tailor!

I'm here to help you create a smart CV generation system that learns about your experience and creates perfectly customized CVs for each job you apply to.

This setup will take about 10-15 minutes and involves:
1. Getting your CV data imported 
2. Understanding your career goals and preferences
3. Setting up your professional profile for optimal customization

Ready to get started? Let's make job applications easier and more effective!
```

### Step 1: CV Import (Conversational)
```
üìÑ First, let's get your CV information imported.

I can work with several formats - what works best for you?

A) I have a PDF of my current CV
B) I'd like to use my LinkedIn profile  
C) I want to paste my CV text directly
D) I have my CV in a Word document
E) I'm not sure what format would work best

[Wait for user response, then provide specific instructions based on their choice]
```

#### For PDF Upload (Option A):
```
Perfect! PDF upload is usually the easiest method.

üìé You can either:
1. Attach the PDF file directly to this conversation, OR  
2. Save your CV as "cv.pdf" and let me know when you've got it ready

Which would you prefer?

[If attachment]: Great! I can see your CV file. Let me process it now...
[If file save]: No problem! Just let me know when you've saved it as "cv.pdf" and I'll import it.
```

#### For LinkedIn (Option B):
```
Excellent choice! LinkedIn profiles often have the most complete information.

I can work with LinkedIn in two ways:

üîπ **Quick method**: Export your LinkedIn profile as PDF
   - Go to your LinkedIn profile
   - Click "More" ‚Üí "Save to PDF"  
   - Then attach that PDF here or save it as "linkedin.pdf"

üîπ **Complete method**: Download your full LinkedIn data (recommended)
   - Go to LinkedIn Settings & Privacy
   - Click "Get a copy of your data"
   - This gives me access to all your details, including things not visible on your profile

Which appeals to you more? The quick method gets us started faster, but the complete method gives better results.
```

#### For Text Paste (Option C):
```
That works perfectly! Text input gives me exactly what you want included.

Just paste your entire CV below - include everything: work experience, education, skills, projects, awards, anything you think might be relevant for job applications.

Don't worry about formatting - I'll structure it properly.

[Paste your CV here]

[After they paste]: Thanks! I can see your CV content. Let me process this information...
```

### Step 2: Import Processing & Validation
```
üîÑ Processing your CV...

[Run appropriate import based on their choice]

‚úÖ Import complete! I found:
- [X] work positions
- [X] educational entries  
- [X] skills mentioned
- [X] other sections

Let me ask a few quick questions to make sure I understood everything correctly:

1. I see you worked at [Company] as [Role] from [Dates]. Does that look right?

2. For skills, I found: [list top 5-6 skills]. Are these your strongest/most relevant skills, or would you prioritize others?

3. What type of roles are you primarily interested in? (This helps me understand how to position your experience)
```

### Step 3: Professional Context & Goals
```
Great! Now let me understand your career context better so I can customize CVs effectively:

üéØ **Career Goals**
What type of roles are you primarily targeting? (For example: "Senior Product Designer roles at tech companies" or "Marketing manager positions in healthcare")

üìç **Geographic Preferences** 
Are you looking locally, willing to relocate, or interested in remote work?

üíº **Industry Focus**
Are there specific industries or company types you're most interested in? (This helps me emphasize relevant experience)

‚≠ê **Career Highlights**
What are you most proud of in your career so far? (Helps me know what to emphasize)

üéöÔ∏è **Experience Level**
How would you describe your current career stage?
- Early career (0-3 years)
- Mid-level (3-7 years) 
- Senior (7-15 years)
- Executive/Leadership (15+ years)
```

### Step 4: CV Customization Preferences
```
Perfect! A few preferences to make your CVs work better:

üìù **CV Style Preferences**
What type of companies are you primarily applying to?
- Tech/Startups (casual, results-focused style)
- Corporate/Enterprise (formal, structured style)
- Creative/Agency (innovative, portfolio-focused style)  
- Mixed/Various (I'll adapt per job)

üìä **Information Depth**
For work experience descriptions, do you prefer:
- Detailed (more bullet points, comprehensive)
- Concise (focused on key achievements only)
- Adaptive (detailed for relevant experience, concise for older roles)

üìè **CV Length**
What's your preference?
- 1 page maximum (concise, recent experience focus)
- 2 pages okay (comprehensive experience showcase)
- Whatever length serves the role best
```

### Step 5: Verification & Quality Check
```
üîç **Quick Verification**

Based on our conversation, let me verify I understand your profile correctly:

**Career Focus**: [Summary based on their responses]
**Key Strengths**: [List main skills/experience areas]
**Target Roles**: [Their stated goals]
**Geographic Scope**: [Their preferences]

Does this sound right? Anything you'd like to adjust or add?

Also, I noticed [mention any gaps or areas that might need clarification]. We can address these when you apply to specific jobs.
```

### Step 6: Setup Complete & Next Steps
```
üéâ **Setup Complete!**

Your My CV Tailor is now configured and ready to use! Here's what I've created:

üìÅ **Your Profile Structure**:
- Personal info and contact details
- [X] work experiences in individual files
- Skills categorized by type
- Education and qualifications
- [Other sections found]

üéØ **Your Preferences**:
- Target roles: [Their goals]
- Style preference: [Their choice]
- Geographic scope: [Their preference]

**üöÄ Ready for Your First Application?**

When you find a job you want to apply for:
1. Just share the job posting with me (paste the text or share the URL)
2. I'll analyze how well you fit and ask targeted questions about any gaps
3. Then I'll generate a perfectly customized CV and cover letter

Would you like to try this now with a job posting, or do you have any questions about how the system works?

**üí° Pro Tip**: The system gets better with each application as it learns more about your experience!
```

## Safety & Quality Guidelines

### During Conversation:
- Ask one question at a time to avoid overwhelming
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
- Never assume details not explicitly provided
- Offer examples to clarify what you're asking for
- Be encouraging and supportive throughout

### For Technical Processing:
- Run actual import commands based on user's input method
- Validate imported data and highlight any issues
- Ask for clarification on ambiguous items
- Store user preferences for future CV generation

### Error Handling:
```
If import fails:
"I had trouble reading that file. This sometimes happens with scanned PDFs or complex formatting. Would you like to try a different format, or can you paste the text directly?"

If user seems confused:
"No worries! Let me explain that differently..." [provide simpler explanation]

If they want to skip steps:
"I understand you want to move quickly! We can always come back and add more details later. Let's get the basics set up first."
```

## Post-Setup Actions

After successful setup:
1. Create user preference file in `/data/user-preferences.md`
2. Generate welcome summary showing what was captured
3. Offer to try first job analysis immediately
4. Provide quick reference for future use

This conversational approach ensures users feel guided and confident while building a complete, accurate professional profile for optimal CV customization.
