## Generation Process

### Step 1: Extract Key Elements

#### From Job Analysis
- Specific role title and department
- 2-3 most critical requirements
- Company values and culture indicators
- Hiring manager name (if available)
- Application context (referral, job board, etc.)

#### From Verification Log

- Transferable skills worth highlighting
- Cultural fit indicators from past roles

#### From Personal Data
- Current title and company

### Step 2: Craft Opening Paragraph

#### Template Structure
```
Dear [Hiring Manager/Hiring Team],

[Hook: Specific interest or connection] + [Role application] + [Brief value proposition based on strongest verified match]
```

#### Hook Options
- **Company Connection**: "Having followed [Company]'s work on [specific project/initiative]..."
- **Referral**: "[Contact name] recommended I reach out about..."  
- **Achievement Alignment**: "When I [specific verified achievement], I realized..."
- **Industry Insight**: "As someone who has [relevant experience], I'm excited by [company direction]..."

#### Example Opening
```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

Having followed GitLab's innovative approach to remote-first product development, I'm excited to apply for the Senior Product Designer position. My 15+ years designing enterprise B2B software and technical interfaces for distributed teams at companies like Datameer directly aligns with GitLab's needs for complex developer tools and admin interfaces.
```

### Step 3: Build Body Paragraphs

#### Paragraph 1: Primary Qualification
Lead with strongest verified experience:

```
[Transition to main qualification] + [Specific verified example with metrics] + [Direct connection to role requirements]
```

Example:
```
At Datameer, I led the design of complex data visualization interfaces used by technical teams at Fortune 500 companies. I redesigned the admin panel architecture, resulting in 40% faster task completion for platform administrators and 60% reduction in support tickets. This experience directly maps to GitLab's need for intuitive developer tools and technical interfaces that scale across diverse user skill levels.
```

#### Paragraph 2: Additional Value
Combine 2-3 supporting qualifications:

```
[Secondary verified skill] + [Cultural/team fit example] + [Growth mindset or learning ability]
```

Example:
```
Beyond technical design skills, my experience managing design teams at Staffbase and mentoring junior designers aligns with GitLab's collaborative culture. I've consistently worked in fast-paced, data-driven environments where user feedback directly shaped product decisions - an approach I see reflected in GitLab's transparent, iteration-focused development process.
```

#### Paragraph 3: Company Knowledge + Enthusiasm
Show specific interest and research:

```
[Specific company knowledge] + [Genuine enthusiasm] + [Value you bring to their mission]
```

Example:
```
I'm particularly drawn to GitLab's mission of democratizing software development through intuitive tools. Your recent expansion into CI/CD visualization features represents exactly the type of complex technical interface design challenges I've solved throughout my career. I'm excited to contribute to tools that empower development teams worldwide to ship better software faster.
```

### Step 4: Professional Closing

#### Standard Structure
```
[Enthusiasm for next steps] + [Interview availability] + [Professional sign-off]
```

Example:
```
I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my verified experience designing enterprise technical interfaces can contribute to GitLab's continued growth. I'm available for interviews at your convenience and happy to provide additional portfolio examples.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
