# Honest Positioning Examples for CV Summaries

## Purpose
This guide provides examples of honest, factual CV summaries that avoid exaggeration while still presenting strengths effectively.

## ❌ Avoid These Patterns

### Exaggerated Language
- "Proven architect with extensive expertise..."
- "Deep experience across all aspects of..."
- "Master of design systems..."
- "Expert-level proficiency in..."
- "Unparalleled success in..."

### Overstated Claims
- Claiming to be an "architect" when you've contributed to systems
- Using "led" when you "participated in"
- Saying "designed" when you "helped design"
- Claiming "expertise" with less than 5 years focused experience

## ✅ Use These Patterns

### Honest Positioning Templates

**For Career Transitions:**
"[Current role] with experience in [relevant skill area] seeking to specialize in [target area]. Have [specific relevant experience] as part of broader [context]. Ready to apply [transferable skills] in a dedicated [target role]."

**For Partial Experience:**
"[Role] with hands-on experience building [specific deliverables] across [number] organizations. Skilled in [verified skills] with a focus on [specific area]. Looking to deepen expertise in [growth area]."

**For Leadership Roles:**
"Design leader who has [specific verified achievements] while managing teams of [actual size]. Experience includes [specific relevant work] with emphasis on [key strength]. Interested in [honest goal]."

## Real Examples

### Instead of:
"Design systems architect with proven expertise in building scalable component libraries"

### Write:
"Design leader who has built and managed design systems as part of product design roles at multiple companies"

### Instead of:
"Expert in cross-functional collaboration with extensive experience"

### Write:
"Experienced in fostering collaboration between design and engineering teams through shared processes and tools"

### Instead of:
"Deep expertise in design tokens and component governance"

### Write:
"Have implemented design tokens in Figma and established component libraries across several organizations"

## Key Principles

1. **Use "experience with" instead of "expert in"**
2. **Acknowledge when something was part of a broader role**
3. **Be specific about actual contributions**
4. **Use numbers only when verified**
5. **Show growth mindset rather than claiming mastery**
6. **Position transitions honestly**

## Words to Use Sparingly
- Expert, Master, Architect (unless job title)
- Extensive, Deep, Proven
- Led (unless you were the decision maker)
- Designed (unless you were primary designer)
- Built (unless you were primary builder)

## Better Alternative Words
- Experience with, Skilled in, Familiar with
- Contributed to, Participated in, Supported
- Helped develop, Collaborated on
- Part of team that, Worked on
- Implemented, Created, Developed

Remember: Honesty builds trust and sets realistic expectations for interviews.
