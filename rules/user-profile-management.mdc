**Personalization Framework:**
```python
# Profile-based personalization logic
def apply_personalization(user_profile, interaction_context):
    communication_style = user_profile.get('communication_style')
    career_stage = user_profile.get('career_stage')
    risk_tolerance = user_profile.get('risk_tolerance')
    target_context = user_profile.get('target_roles')
    
    # Adapt communication
    if communication_style == 'conservative':
        tone = 'professional_understated'
        risk_positioning = 'safe_verified_achievements'
    elif communication_style == 'modern':
        tone = 'strategic_confident'
        risk_positioning = 'strategic_optimization'
    elif communication_style == 'creative':
        tone = 'personality_forward_professional'
        risk_positioning = 'creative_differentiation'
    
    # Adapt content depth
    if career_stage in ['IC', 'individual_contributor']:
        focus = 'technical_depth_collaboration'
        leadership_emphasis = 'potential_and_growth'
    elif career_stage in ['team_lead', 'manager']:
        focus = 'balanced_ic_and_leadership'
        leadership_emphasis = 'demonstrated_team_impact'
    elif career_stage in ['director', 'executive']:
        focus = 'strategic_organizational_impact'
        leadership_emphasis = 'cultural_business_influence'
    
    return PersonalizationConfig(tone, risk_positioning, focus, leadership_emphasis)
```
