# Rule: Verify Experience (Enhanced Safety-First)

## Goal
Ask targeted questions to verify user's experience against job requirements without making assumptions or leading them to overstate qualifications. Focus heavily on extracting qualitative impacts, process improvements, and strategic positioning details that demonstrate value even without quantitative metrics.

## System Context Integration
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Load user profile and core system prompt to personalize verification:

1. **Read Core System Prompt**: `/system-prompt/core-system-prompt.md` for IMPACT framework and truthfulness standards
2. **Read User Profile**: `/data/user-profile.md` for personalized verification approach:
   - Career stage determines question depth and leadership focus
   - Industry experience guides technical and domain-specific probing
   - Communication style affects question tone and risk tolerance
   - Gap analysis priorities from profile inform verification sequence
   - Interview confidence level shapes preparation depth needed

**Personalization Application:**
- Adapt question complexity to user's experience level and career stage
- Focus verification on profile-identified strength and development areas
- Match questioning style to user's communication preferences and confidence
- Prioritize verification areas based on target role alignment from profile
- Apply appropriate IMPACT framework depth for user's seniority level

## Prerequisites
- Job analysis completed (`analyze-job-posting.mdc`)
- Initial CV imported
- Gaps identified between requirements and current data

## WORKFLOW POSITION
This rule is Step 2 in the mandatory sequence:
1. ✅ Job analysis (`analyze-job-posting.mdc`)
2. ⏳ **CURRENT:** Experience verification (`verify-experience.mdc`)
3. ⏭️ **NEXT:** CV generation (`generate-cv.mdc`)
4. ⏭️ **OPTIONAL:** Cover letter (`generate-cover-letter.mdc`)

## Enhanced Verification Process

### Step 1: Load and Analyze Existing Documentation
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Before generating any questions, systematically review all existing data files:

1. **Read All Experience Files**: Load content from `/data/experiences/` to understand documented work history
2. **Read User Profile**: Load `/data/user-profile.md` for personalization context
3. **Read Verification Logs**: Check `/data/verification-log/` for previously verified information
4. **Read Core System Prompt**: Load `/system-prompt/core-system-prompt.md` for IMPACT framework standards

#### Smart Question Generation Based on Existing Data
From this comprehensive data analysis, identify:
- **Fully Documented**: Experiences with complete IMPACT framework context - **SKIP THESE**
- **Partially Documented**: Skills mentioned in data files but lacking strategic depth - **ENHANCE WITH CONTEXT**
- **Gap Areas**: Must-have requirements with no verified match in existing data files - **DIRECT QUESTIONING**
- **Clarification Needed**: Experiences that could demonstrate strategic value but need qualification - **TARGETED PROBING**
- **Missing Context**: Process improvements, team collaboration, or technology implementation lacking business context - **CONTEXTUAL ENHANCEMENT**

#### Existing Data Integration Rules
**NEVER ASK ABOUT:**
- Information already fully documented with IMPACT framework context
- Experiences with complete before/after process descriptions
- Skills with verified examples and strategic positioning
- Company contexts already described with business model clarity
- Technology implementations with full adoption and impact details

**ALWAYS SHOW EXISTING KNOWLEDGE WHEN ASKING FOR ENHANCEMENT:**
- Display what's already documented before asking for additional context
- Reference specific files and previous answers
- Ask for clarification or additional depth, not repetition
- Build upon existing information rather than starting from scratch

### Step 2: Generate Enhanced Targeted Questions

#### Enhanced Question Categories

**1. Missing Requirements with Strategic Context**
For skills/experience not found in existing data files:
```
"The role requires [specific requirement]. I don't see this documented in your experience files. Let me ask about this strategically:

- **NEW:** Test interview readiness with follow-up scenario questions

### Enhanced Question Techniques

#### Excellent Verification Questions
- "Walk me through exactly how [process] worked before and after your changes"
- "What specific feedback did you receive that showed this was working?"
- "How did you know this was an improvement - what evidence convinced you?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't done this work?"
- "Who were the key stakeholders and how did they respond to your approach?"

#### Advanced Follow-Up Probes
- "What was the most challenging part of this implementation?"
- "How did you measure success - both officially and in your own assessment?"
- "What did you learn about [technology/process/leadership] from this experience?"
- "How would you do this differently if you encountered a similar situation?"
- "What advice would you give someone attempting something similar?"

#### Strategic Context Questions
- "How did this work connect to broader business goals or challenges?"
