# Rule: Verify Experience (Safety-First)

## Goal
Ask targeted questions to verify user's experience against job requirements without making assumptions or leading them to overstate qualifications.

## Prerequisites
- Job analysis completed
- Initial CV imported
- Gaps identified between requirements and current data

## Verification Process

### Step 1: Load Verification Queue
From job analysis, identify:
- Must-have requirements with no verified match
- Skills mentioned in CV but lacking specific context
- Experiences that could be relevant but need clarification

### Step 2: Generate Targeted Questions

#### Question Categories

**1. Missing Requirements**
For skills/experience not found in imported CV:
```
"The role requires [specific requirement]. Have you worked with this in any of your positions? 

If yes:
- Which company was this at?
- What specific project or task involved this?
- What was your exact role and contribution?
- Any measurable outcomes or results?"

If no:
- "Have you used similar tools/methods like [related alternatives]?"
- "Any academic, personal, or volunteer experience with this?"
```

**2. Clarify Existing Claims**
For vague or general statements in CV:
```
Original CV Statement: "[Vague description]"

Questions:
- "Can you provide a specific example of when you did this?"
- "What was the scale/scope of this work? (team size, budget, timeline)"
- "What tools or technologies did you specifically use?"
- "What was the measurable impact or outcome?"
```

**3. Context Enhancement**
For skills mentioned without sufficient detail:
```
"You mentioned [skill/tool]. Can you tell me:
- How long have you been using this?
- In what context (daily work, one-time project, training)?
- What level would you consider yourself (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?
- Any specific achievements or challenges with this tool?"
```

### Step 3: Question Sequencing

#### Priority Order
1. **Critical Gaps**: Must-have requirements missing from CV
2. **Enhancement Opportunities**: Existing experience needing detail
3. **Transferable Skills**: Related experience that might apply
4. **Nice-to-Haves**: Preferred qualifications with potential matches

#### Safety Protocols
- Never suggest answers or lead responses
- Ask for specific examples, not general claims
- Request context and details, not just yes/no
- Probe for measurable outcomes
- Distinguish between exposure and expertise

### Step 4: Question Delivery

#### Format Example
```
üìã Experience Verification: [Company] - [Role]

I need to verify some experience details to ensure accurate representation in your CV. Please be specific and honest - it's better to be accurate than optimistic.

üîç Priority Questions:

1. **[Requirement]** - Required for this role
   Current Status: Not found in your CV
   
   Question: "The job requires experience with [specific tool/skill]. Have you worked with this at any company? If yes:
   - Which position was this?
   - Describe exactly what you did with it
   - How long did you use it?
   - Any specific projects or results?"

2. **[Another Requirement]**
   Current Status: Mentioned briefly in CV
   
   Question: "You mention [skill] at [Company]. Can you provide more detail:
   - What specific tasks required this skill?
   - How frequently did you use it?
   - Any measurable outcomes or achievements?"

[Continue for all priority items...]

üìù Verification Rules:
- Only include experience you can confidently discuss in an interview
- Provide specific examples, not general statements
- It's okay to say "no" - honesty protects your reputation
- Context matters: brief exposure ‚â† professional experience
```

### Step 5: Response Processing

#### Verification Levels
- **Verified**: Specific examples with context and outcomes
- **Basic**: General experience but lacking detail
- **Related**: Adjacent experience that might transfer
- **None**: No relevant experience found

#### Documentation Format
For each verified item, create entry in `/data/verification-log/[job-title]-verification.md`:

```markdown

## Verification Guidelines

- Lead user toward desired responses

### ALWAYS:

### Question Techniques

#### Good Questions

#### Avoid Leading Questions
- ‚ùå "You probably used [tool] for [task], right?"
