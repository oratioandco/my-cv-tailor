2. **Read User Profile**: `/data/user-profile.md` for communication style and experience level
3. **Read Interview Preparation**: `/data/interview-prep/[job-title]-preparation.md` for prepared responses and confidence levels
4. **Read Experience Files**: `/data/experiences/` for background verification and follow-up question potential
5. **Read Verification Logs**: `/data/verification-log/` for STAR story details and confidence assessments
6. **Read Core System Prompt**: `/system-prompt/core-system-prompt.md` for evaluation framework

## Prerequisites
- Job analysis completed (`analyze-job-posting.mdc`)

**Example Question Progression:**
```
INTERVIEWER: "Tell me about a time you had to implement a new design system."

[User provides basic response]

FOLLOW-UP OPTIONS:
- If response shows strong impact: "That's impressive results. What resistance did you encounter during implementation and how did you overcome it?"
- If response lacks detail: "Help me understand the technical challenges better. What specific decisions did you make about component architecture?"
- If response reveals team dynamics: "It sounds like you worked with multiple stakeholders. How did you manage competing priorities between design and engineering?"
```

How would you approach this situation?"

**[Assessment Focus: Problem-solving, prioritization, stakeholder management]**
```

#### Stress Test Variation
```
üé≠ **[STRESS TEST MODE ACTIVE]**

INTERVIEWER: "I notice you were at [Company] for only 14 months. That's pretty short. Then you switched industries entirely. And now you're applying for a role that typically requires more experience than what you have. 

Help me understand - are you someone who gets bored easily and moves on? How do I know you won't do the same thing here?"

**[Assessment Focus: Resilience, honesty, composure under pressure]**
```

#### Technical Deep-Dive
```
üé≠ **[TECHNICAL FOCUS MODE]**

INTERVIEWER: "Let's get into the specifics of your design process. You mentioned implementing a design system at [Company].
