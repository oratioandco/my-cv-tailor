# CRITICAL SYSTEM RULE: Automatic Data File Updating

## THE CORE SUPERPOWER OF MY-CV-TAILOR

üö® **MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: Every interaction with the user that involves new information, corrections, clarifications, or strategic insights MUST automatically result in updated data files.

## WHEN THIS RULE APPLIES

**ALWAYS** - This rule has `alwaysApply: true` and MUST be executed whenever:
- User shares new experience details
- User provides corrections to existing information
- User clarifies dates, locations, roles, or responsibilities
- User adds context about projects, achievements, or impact
- User shares strategic insights or positioning elements
- User provides verification for previously unverified claims

## AUTOMATIC UPDATE WORKFLOW

### 1. IMMEDIATE DETECTION
The system MUST automatically recognize when user has shared information that belongs in the data files:
- ‚úÖ Company locations, dates, roles
- ‚úÖ Project details, achievements, metrics
- ‚úÖ Skills, technologies, methodologies used
- ‚úÖ Strategic business impact and outcomes
- ‚úÖ Cross-functional collaboration details
- ‚úÖ Corrections to previously stored information

### 2. SYSTEMATIC FILE UPDATES
When new information is detected, the system MUST:
- **Read existing data files** to understand current state
- **Identify which files need updates** based on the information type
- **Preserve all existing verified information** while adding new details
- **Apply corrections systematically** across all relevant files
- **Enhance strategic positioning** elements where applicable
- **Update verification status** from unverified to verified

### 3. FILE TYPES TO UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY

#### Experience Files (`/data/experiences/*.md`)
- Add new project details, achievements, metrics
- Correct company information, locations, dates
- Enhance IMPACT framework elements
- Update team size, reporting structure, collaboration details
- Add strategic business context and outcomes

#### Skills Files (`/data/skills/*.md`)
- Add newly mentioned technical skills, tools, methodologies
- Update proficiency levels based on user clarifications
- Add strategic application context and business outcomes
- Create new skill categories when appropriate

#### Project Files (`/data/projects/*.md`)
- Add detailed project information and outcomes
- Update timelines, budgets, team structures
- Add strategic business impact and user feedback
- Enhance with methodology and technology details

#### Strategic Positioning (`/data/strategic-positioning.md`)
- Update competitive advantages based on new information
- Enhance market positioning elements
- Add interview-ready story elements
- Update verification status and confidence levels

### 4. QUALITY STANDARDS FOR AUTOMATIC UPDATES

#### NEVER:
- Remove existing verified information
- Overwrite user's exact language with paraphrasing
- Add information the user did not actually provide
- Make assumptions beyond what user explicitly stated
- Combine separate pieces of information inappropriately

#### ALWAYS:
- Preserve user's exact language and specific details
- Add source references showing where information came from
- Update verification status appropriately
- Maintain chronological accuracy
- Enhance strategic positioning while staying truthful
- Create comprehensive, interview-ready documentation

### 5. VERIFICATION AND DOCUMENTATION

Every automatic update MUST include:
- **Source reference**: "Source: Conversation [Date]" or "Source: User clarification [Date]"
- **Verification status update**: Change from "No" to "Yes" where appropriate
- **Strategic context**: How this information enhances positioning
- **Interview readiness**: Ensure information can be defended in interviews

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The automatic updating system is working correctly when:
- ‚úÖ User NEVER has to ask "did you update the knowledge base?"
- ‚úÖ All shared information is immediately captured in appropriate files
- ‚úÖ Corrections are applied systematically across all relevant files
- ‚úÖ Strategic positioning is enhanced with each interaction
- ‚úÖ Knowledge base grows continuously with each conversation
- ‚úÖ Information is always current, accurate, and comprehensive

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

üö® **CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE** occurs when:
- ‚ùå User shares information that doesn't get automatically captured
- ‚ùå User has to remind system to update data files
- ‚ùå Corrections aren't applied systematically
- ‚ùå New strategic insights aren't documented
- ‚ùå Verification status isn't updated appropriately

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT

This rule MUST be integrated into every workflow:
- **Job Analysis**: Capture company research and strategic insights
- **Experience Verification**: Document all verified details immediately
- **CV Generation**: Update files with any new information shared during generation
- **General Conversations**: Capture corrections, clarifications, and new details

The automatic data file updating is what makes my-CV-tailor uniquely powerful - it learns and improves with every interaction, building a comprehensive, strategically positioned knowledge base that enables perfect CV generation and interview preparation.

**THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE - IT MUST ALWAYS HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY.**
