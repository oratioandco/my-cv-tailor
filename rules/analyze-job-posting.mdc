# Rule: Analyze Job Posting & Determine Fit

## Goal
Extract requirements from job postings and provide honest assessment of user fit without making assumptions. This analysis drives the verification questions and CV customization process.

## Input Handling

### Step 1: Accept Job Input
Handle two input methods:
1. **Text Input**: User pastes job description directly
2. **URL Input**: Fetch and parse job posting from URL

For URL inputs:
```bash
# Use appropriate tool to fetch content
# Parse HTML to extract job description
# Save raw content to /data/jobs/[company]-[role]-raw.md
```

### Step 2: Extract Key Information

Create analysis file `/data/jobs/[company]-[role]-analysis.md`:

```markdown
# Job Analysis: [Company] - [Role Title]

## Basic Information
- Company: [Name]
- Role: [Exact title]
- Location: [If specified]
- Type: [Full-time/Contract/etc]
- Posted Date: [If available]
- Application Deadline: [If specified]

## Requirements Extraction

### Must-Have Requirements
[Requirements marked as required, mandatory, must-have]
1. [Requirement]: 
   - Original Text: "[Exact quote]"
   - Category: [Technical/Experience/Soft Skill]
   - Specific Metrics: [Years, level, etc if mentioned]

### Nice-to-Have Requirements  
[Requirements marked as preferred, bonus, nice-to-have]
1. [Requirement]:
   - Original Text: "[Exact quote]"
   - Category: [Technical/Experience/Soft Skill]

### Implicit Requirements
[Industry standards not explicitly stated but likely expected]
1. [Requirement]:
   - Reasoning: [Why this is likely required]
   - Importance: [High/Medium/Low]

## Company Culture Indicators
- Tone: [Formal/Casual/Technical]
- Values Emphasized: [List key themes]
- Work Style: [Remote/Hybrid/Office]
- Team Size: [If mentioned]

## Keywords for ATS
### Primary Keywords
[Most frequently mentioned technical terms and skills]

### Secondary Keywords
[Related terms and industry jargon]

### Action Verbs Used
[Verbs that should be mirrored in CV]
```

### Step 3: Initial Fit Assessment

Calculate honest fit score:

```markdown
## Fit Assessment

### Confirmed Matches
[Check against existing verified data only]
- ‚úÖ [Requirement]: Verified in [data file reference]
- ‚úÖ [Requirement]: Confirmed experience at [Company]

### Potential Matches
[Skills/experience that might qualify but need verification]
- ‚ùì [Requirement]: Possible match - need to verify [specific aspect]
- ‚ùì [Requirement]: Related experience in [area] - needs clarification

### Clear Gaps
[Requirements with no apparent match in current data]
- ‚ùå [Requirement]: No evidence in current profile
- ‚ùå [Requirement]: Would need [specific verification]

### Fit Score Calculation
- Must-Have Matches: [X]/[Total] = [%]
- Nice-to-Have Matches: [X]/[Total] = [%]
- Overall Fit: [Weighted average]%

### Recommendation
[Based on score]
- 90-100%: Excellent fit - proceed with confidence
- 70-89%: Good fit - emphasize transferable skills
- 60-69%: Moderate fit - be selective, focus on strengths
- Below 60%: Poor fit - consider if growth opportunity aligns with goals
```

### Step 4: Generate Verification Questions

Create targeted questions for gap analysis:

```markdown
## Verification Needed

### Priority 1: Must-Have Gaps
1. **[Requirement]**
   - Current Status: No verified experience
   - Question: "The role requires [specific thing]. Have you worked with this at any of your positions? If yes, which company and what specifically did you do?"
   - Follow-up: "Can you describe a specific project or achievement related to this?"

### Priority 2: Enhance Existing Matches  
1. **[Requirement]**
   - Current Status: Basic match found
   - Question: "You mention [skill] at [Company]. Can you provide specific examples, metrics, or projects that demonstrate this?"

### Priority 3: Transferable Skills
1. **[Requirement]**
   - Question: "While you haven't worked directly with [X], have you used similar tools/methods like [Y, Z] that demonstrate comparable skills?"
```

### Step 5: Industry Context

Add competitive intelligence:

```markdown
## Industry Context

### Similar Roles Research
- Typical Requirements: [Common patterns in similar postings]
- Salary Range: [If available from research]
- Career Path: [Typical progression]

### Company Insights
- Recent News: [Relevant developments]
- Tech Stack: [From job posting or research]
- Growth Areas: [What they're investing in]

### Competitive Advantage
Based on your profile:
- Unique Strengths: [What sets you apart]
- Positioning Strategy: [How to frame experience]
```

## Output Format

Provide user-friendly summary:

```

## Safety Principles

- Never assume skills based on job titles
- Don't inflate fit scores to encourage applications
- Be transparent about significant gaps
- Provide honest market context
- Suggest alternatives if fit is poor
- Focus on building accurate, defensible narratives

This analysis ensures users only apply to appropriate roles with CVs that honestly represent their qualifications while maximizing their legitimate strengths.
