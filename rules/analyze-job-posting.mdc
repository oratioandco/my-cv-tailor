# Rule: Analyze Job Posting & Determine Strategic Fit (Enhanced)

## Goal
Extract requirements from job postings with design-specific intelligence and provide honest, strategic assessment of user fit without making assumptions. This analysis drives targeted verification questions and enables strategic CV customization for maximum impact.

## System Context Integration
**MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** Load user profile and core system prompt to personalize analysis:

1. **Read Core System Prompt**: `/system-prompt/core-system-prompt.md` for expert design industry knowledge
2. **Read User Profile**: `/data/user-profile.md` for personalized context including:
   - Career stage and experience level
   - Industry background and preferences  
   - Communication style and risk tolerance
   - Target role context and application strategy
   - Historical success patterns and gap areas

**Personalization Application:**
- Tailor fit assessment to user's actual experience level and career stage
- Apply industry context from user's background for relevance scoring
- Use communication style preferences for cultural fit analysis
- Consider target role alignment with user's career progression goals
- Factor in application strategy (selective vs volume) for recommendation timing

## ⚠️ ENHANCED TRUTHFULNESS MANDATE
This analysis MUST be completely honest about fit levels and experience gaps while providing strategic insights for positioning. Do NOT overstate qualifications or suggest fabricating experience. When experience is limited or missing, identify these as strategic learning opportunities or areas requiring honest gap navigation with transferable skill bridges.

## Enhanced Input Handling

### Step 1: Multi-Modal Job Input Processing
Handle comprehensive input methods:
1. **Direct Text Input**: User pastes complete job description
2. **URL Input**: Fetch and parse job posting from company website
3. **PDF Upload**: Extract text from uploaded job posting files
4. **Structured Input**: Form-based input for missing details

For URL inputs:
```bash
# Use web fetch tool to retrieve content
# Parse HTML/structured data to extract job description
# Save raw content to /data/jobs/[company]-[role]-raw.md
# Extract company research data for strategic context
```

### Step 2: Enhanced Information Extraction

Create comprehensive analysis file `/data/jobs/[company]-[role]-analysis.md`:
